# True-Democracy-Website
It is the first political website which makes Leaders and people accountable. 

The whole concept of this website is based on a single word "accountability".

Our intention is to make the government answerable to every step they make, and provide a medium for people to judge the Members of the Legislature. 

It is a political website for people. our intention is to make the government accountable or answerable to every step they make.

At present it is only concerned with Andhra pradesh state(A state in India).

As we know the state is divided into 175 constituencies and it is difficult for people to approach the head of the constituency (which is the seating mla) for every trouble they have. Our website (satya lokatantra or True Democrary) provides a platform for every such person.

It is equally important for the Mla(government official) to know the problems faced by individuals in their ruling area. so our website bridges the gap between the people and government to present their issues and actions respectively.

In our website one can request or register a complaint (after proper authentication) to the political officials of state government namely MLA's on their problems in their area based on given tag's( like water,women security, etc..)

Based on the requests which are taken(pincodes included from gps),are shown in a graph format for better visualization to governemt officials.

The problems can then be reviewed by officials and can mark them as solved.

By this one can make a proper decision whether present leaders are accountable to be elected to represent us.
Staya Lokatantra is Made to be Responsive, create true leaders, and help the nation move towards development. 

One can view the activeness of an government official towards the people.
